CI
1. CI steps = Build -> test -> Lint -> security
2. Pull Request -> trigger ci steps -> Staging ENV for QA test
3. IF everything is ok -> Pull Request to  main branch -> Test CI steps again after merging to test that everything is ok
4. we do so because some features could have happened to the main branch
5. if everything is ok we apply the PR to main and we can mark it as a release.
6. trigger on PR to main VS push to main ( PR changes only , PR + main).
